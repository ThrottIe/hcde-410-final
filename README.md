This project is a research study on whether socio-economic standing affects the ability for an individual to get involved in the cryptocurrency industry. By involvement, we mean perform transactions as well as become a contributer to the block chain. The first half of the project provides the mathematical background needed to understand how decentralized cryptocurrency are effective. Once the rigor has been established, the second half of the project describes how participating in mining can be more difficult for individuals in a lower socio-economic standing. This is done through analysis of GPU parts data and comparing with the prices of BitCoin and Etherium over the past year.
