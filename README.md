This project is a research study on whether socio-economic standing affects the ability for an individual to get involved in the cryptocurrency industry. By involvement, we mean perform transactions as well as become a contributer to the block chain. 
The first half of the project provides the mathematical background needed to understand how decentralized cryptocurrency are effective. In this section, we introduce what the peer-to-peer transaction network is and how mathematical solvability ensures that the coinbase is protected against fraud. Then we introduce the concept of a public block-chain and address how the reward system for cryptocurrency works. 

Once the rigor has been established, the second half of the project describes how participating in mining can be more difficult for individuals in a lower socio-economic standing. This is done through analysis of GPU parts data and comparing with the prices of BitCoin and Etherium over the past year. A miner utilizes the GPU of a computer to exhaustive search for a solution to a function which then adds the transaction to the blockchain. However, it has been found that individuals are buying products in bulk and this strongly correlated with the increased demand for cryptocurrency
