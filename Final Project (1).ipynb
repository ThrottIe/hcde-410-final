    "Crypocurrency is a topic that is important to discuss. With the increase in companies accepting cryptocurrency as payment, it is becoming more integral to people's lives. Due to its decentralized and anonymous nature, it eliminates the need for a governing body to dictate its value and relies purely on supply and demand (Farrel, 2015). When Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, one of its greatest benefits was that it employed a peer-to-peer transaction system that relied on cryptographic proof instead of \"trust\" (Farrel, 2015). By doing this, Bitcoin replaced human actions with mathematical algorithms. However, this system gave to rise to new problems associated with double spending and coinage protection, topics that are addressed in the background information section. Since the cryptocurrency industry is relatively new and interest has recently increased, there is little research into how groups are able to take advantage of it compared to establishing how the coin works. Furthermore, there exists many different coin varieties that employ different algorithms which significantly increases the scope of what is possible to research. In this project, I will focus on systems (BitCoin and DogeCoin) that have existed for many years and have a large cultural impact. "

    "The initial motivation for proposing this project comes from my lack of previous knowledge on this issue. I decided on cryptocurrency because I wished to learn more about digital transactions, hashing algorithms and cryptography systems. In quarantine, I was heavily invested in mathematical theory but did not focus on applying a human centered perspective to what I was learning. This class has allowed me to see that data ethics is heavily important and that replacing human actions with algorithms isn't enough to remove prejudices and biases that were present before. Hence, in addition to investigating how cryptosystems work, I intend to address the question of whether having a privalged position in society allows you to take advantage of the system\n",

    "Bitcoin was developed with the intention of replacing physical objects with a \"computer file\" (Velde, 2013). It functions on the same principles as currency- exchange something of value for goods and services. However, for a physical transaction, there is a guarantee that you are giving the money to another paty and that you are receiving something in return (ignoring the issue of counterfeiting). How can we guarentee that if we exchange Bitcoin, one party is guarenteed to receive it? Futhermore, digital signatures can easily be duplicated on a computer so how are we able to guarentee that double-spending does not occur? To prevent this, Bitcoin can only be spent and received after they have been publicly recorded in a ledge, known as the \"block chain\". To transfer a coin, the transcation is first recorded in a public ledger, where a new signature is made by combining the time stamp with the digital signatures of each party (Farrel, 2015). This new signature represents the path that a coin has taken in the network and is then broadcasted to all nodes in the blockchain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, let Alice be the owner of a Bitcoin which is essentially a string of 1s and 0s that is stored in a physical hard drive (called the \"wallet\")  (Velde, 2013). She wishes to send this coin to Bob who also has a wallet on his device (Note that these \"wallets\" are managed by an application the computer) (Velde, 2013). Then Alice's application broadcastes to a network of nodes indicating that there is a proposed transaction between Alice and Bob. Then the \"Miners\" gather the proposed transaction and attempt to add it to the block chain, which makes the transfer valid. The key for preventing fraud is to ensure that adding to the block chain is \"difficult\". As an analogy to the physical medium, think of this as saying when a merchant transfers a precious metal, it is clear that the merchant didn't \"fake\" it because of the amount of costly resources it takes to acquire it. However, it is very easy to check that it is indeed a precious metal. For Bitcoin, the process is similar but utilizes a **hash function**, a function that takes in text and numbers and maps it to a fixed integer. A **Miner** solves the problem (Velde, 2013):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given the current blockchain $x$, a new (proposed) block $y$, a hashing function $f$ a fixed value $\\alpha$, find an $n$ s.t $f(x,y,n) <= \\alpha$**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of this process hinges on the fact that it is very difficult to find $n$ given only $x,y,f, \\alpha$ but it is very easy to check that for a given $n$, $f(x,y,n) <= \\alpha$ holds. To address the issue of double spending, finding $n$ for a given new addition $y$ verifies whether no previous bitcoin transaction involving $y$ existed. When $y$ is added to the block chain $x$, the transaction becomes official and the bitcoin has been transferred to Bob. "

    "When the first miner succesfully makes an addition to the block chain, the message is broadcasted to the Blockchain and the miner receives $N$ new bitcoin attributed to it, a reward for the resources used. The Bitcoin protocol keeps the hashing function constant but changes $\\alpha$ and $N$ over time, depending on how many new nodes (or miners) are added to the blockchain. In the case of Bitcoin, the Blockchain is public so any individual with the proper hardware can send transactions or become a miner (Wikipedia). The reason for providing these rewards is because mining requires high energy consumption and has been critized for being very \"inefficient\". "

    "As stated before, the process of finding $n$ is challenging and can only be done through exhaustive checking. Specifically, solving the mathematical equations comes from constantly running operations on a device until a solution is found. In the beginning, users utilized the CPU but as time went on, the same functions could be run more efficiently on GPUs (Farrel, 2015). Think of mining as a single device that runs constantly and keeps running a hash every second, similar to filling out a lottery ticket until you get a winning ticket. Due to this incentive, GPUs have been very hard to acquire (Uzman, 2021). "

As a start, Doge is an internet meme that was created around 2010 and the coin was designed to initially be a joke (Young, 2018). Though it still has the peer-to-peer model, it has fundamental differences from BitCoin. For once, the circulation of coins is significantly larger than Bitcoin- around 300 billion. Its monetary value per unit is also significantly less and implements a different algorithm for deriving its keys (Young, 2018).

    "For most cryptosystems, the profitability of mining comes from succesfully adding a new block to the block chain. Due to the immense resources required to do this, the algorithm rewards the miner with \"coins\" that are worth a monitary value. While many different algorithms exist depending on the coin, they always involve some kind of hash functions that is easy to verify but difficult to check. Since the prices of GPUs have gone up in recent years, it can be challenging to turn a profit from rewards. It is also unclear whether a user should peform mining individually or whether they should join a pool. On one hand, a pool could potentially allow you to guarentee that you are succesfully validating new blocks but individual mining allows you to maximize profits.
